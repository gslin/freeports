freeports is a FreeBSD ports clone.

You can install ports/devel/git and download http://github.com/gslin/freeports/raw/master/free/freeports/files/999.updateFreePorts to /tmp, then run it and bootstrip the entire freeports system. After this step, you can go to /usr/ports/free to see what's inside this directory.
